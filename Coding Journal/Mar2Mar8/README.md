This week, I decided to practice my algorithims that I am learning. The one in particular is dijkstras algorithim. This algorithim iterates through a weighted graph (assuming no negative edge weights) and outputs the shortest path from a selected point. It leverages a Priority Queue to keep track of the shortest distance up until the current point (this works because of the non negative edge weights). I implemented a class for the algorithim just to get more comfortable with my algs for leetcoding.
