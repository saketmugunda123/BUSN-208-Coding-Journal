For starters, I created the splitwise app. The app has some basic functionalites. It is comprised of a user class and an expense class. The function itself iterates through each expense and reallocates money to the users

Further, I also created the CarMax outlines. There was a car class that had attributes about each car including brand, model, make, and isSportsCar. Then depending on the attributes, I assigned a score to each car in the function.

Finally, for my regular coding this week, I created a calculator to really understand OOP and get comfortable with the swift syntax. It is simply a calculator class that has 4 different methods (add, sub, div, mult) and returns the corresponding value.
