This week I added to the CarMax fucionatliy to create a car picker. To keep it short, you select a car make and model using the dropdown pickers and it saves their selection with a button. Whatever selection the user makes is stored using UserDefaults. Finally, there is also a singleton that handels the selection state safely.
