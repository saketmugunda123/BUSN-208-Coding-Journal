So currently I am working on a call of duty sports predictor. The predictor leverages ML and statistics in order to predict the amount of kills a certain player will get. So, I decided to create a simple frontend functionality for the model. This frontend is simple as it consists of 5 different options. The 5 options are the best 2-man to 6-man parlays for the particular day (parlays are just mulitple bets put together as 1. For example, you have a 2 man, you are betting on BOTH bets hitting). The output is best options for the particular play the user chose. Right now the answers are hardcoded but I would ideally have an API that connects to the backend that would provide the answer.
