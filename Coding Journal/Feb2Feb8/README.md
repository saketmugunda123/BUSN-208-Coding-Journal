So in this week, I completed the 4 queens problem and the tic tac toe logic.

Starting with the 4 queens problem, I solved it using recurison and backtracking. To keep it short, it recurseivly checks if each queen is in a valid position and continues to do this until each queen has been placed.

For the tic tac toe logic, I implemented the simple logic for the game itself. This includes the makemove function and checkwinnner functions that basically execute the basic game logic. makemove simply makes the move and checks if its valid. The checkwinner function checks if the currPlayer has a combination of 3 that is equal to one of the 8 possible winning combinations.

Finally, for some general work this week, I created a very simple frontend for a meal predictor. The actual meal will be recommended based on the backend and a bunch of other of your preferences, but for now I made a simple outline of clicking a button (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) and outputting the meal based on that.
